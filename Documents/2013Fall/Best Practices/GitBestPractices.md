**Git best practices**

1.	Do not work on the master branch (create your own version)


2.	Do not work on somebody else’s branch (create your own version)


3.	In case of testing or playing around work on a different/new branch to avoid commiting those changes to master branch by mistake	


4.	Restrict discussions to the discussion board unless it is on a pull request


5.	Do not merge your own pull requests. We can decide the policy on this.


6.	Do not make changes in the github editor. Make changes in eclipse and push to upstream 


7.	Goto your projects and ignore the following files
	a.	DBmanager.java file in “repository”
	b.	The build folder

8.	If something goes wrong, no need to worry let me know. This is why we are using Git, completely fixable


9.	If I have missed something in this document. Let me know or feel free to add to it on the git repo. (Documents\best practices)
